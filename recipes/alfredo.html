    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo (Italian pronunciation: [fettut't Éine alfredo])[1] or fettuccine al burro ("fettuccine with butter")[2] is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and parmesan (Italian: pasta al burro e parmigiano).[3][4][5] As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.[3] The dish is named after Alfredo Di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the "ceremony" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish.[3][6]
